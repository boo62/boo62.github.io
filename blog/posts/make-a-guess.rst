Guess C_0 and N_0
-----------------

If growth is more or less complete then this is easy. N_0 is the
average final cell amount (given small C_0). We know the typical
dilution used in experiments; 1:10,000 for ditiulted cultures
(i.e. C_0 ~ N_0/10,000 or could just take average C_f of growers
rather than use N_0).

Guess kn
--------

More difficult

Might be possible if we can make good enough guesses of growth
constants r and simulate for different kns.


Guess r
-------

Try fitting a simpler model. Then can guess kn.
