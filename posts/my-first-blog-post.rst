=====================
       Title
=====================

-------------------------------
This is my first post in Nikola
-------------------------------

A paragraph.

  This *paragraph* will result in an indented **block** of text, typically
  used for ``quoting`` other text.

This is another paragraph.

1. Number List

A. Upper-case Letters
   over two lines

   with two paragraphs.

a. lower-case letters

   3. with a sub-list starting at a different number
   4. numbers should be in the correct sequence.
   5. Have a look at the emacs commands for ReST mode.

I. upper-case roman numerals

i. lower-case roman numerals

(1) Numbers again

2) And again

* a bullet point using "*"

  - a sub-list using "-"

    + Yet another sub-list

  - another item.

what
  Definition lists associate a term with a definition

*how*
  The term is a one-line phrase, and the deifinition is one or more
  paragraphs or body elements, indented relative to the term.

  Blank lines are not allowed between term and definition.

Preformatting
-------------

An Example::

      Whitespace, newlines, blank lines, and all kinds of markup
         (like *this* or \this) is preserved by literal blocks.
  Lookie here, I've dropped an indentation level
  (but not far enough)

no more example

Sections
--------

All sections marked with the same adornment style are deemed to be at
the same level.

Chapter 1 Title
===============

Section 1.1 Title
+++++++++++++++++

Subsection 1.1.1 Title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Section 1.2 Title
+++++++++++++++++

Chapter 2 Title
===============

Note that section titles `Section 1.2 Title` are available as link targets, just using
their name.

Document Title / Subtitle
-------------------------

The text of overline-and-underline titles (but not underline-only) may
be inset for aesthetics.
